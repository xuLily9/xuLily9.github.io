I'm a PhD student in the Autonomy and Verification Group from [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). The topic of my Ph.D. is Dialogue Explanation for Neuro-Symbolic AI systems. My work is under the supervision of [Dr. Louise Dennis](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/louise.dennis/) and [Prof. Clare Dixon](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/clare.dixon/) and [Dr.joe Collenette](https://joecol.github.io/). My research interests are in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with a particular focus on using dialogue theory to co-create explanations.

My current research interests include

- Explainable Artificial Intelligence
- Human and AI Collaboration
- Neuro-Symbolic AI
- Large Language Model
